1. Create a git repo and clone it in local
2. Create code.py and code to it.(it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc
4. pip install dvc
5. Now we do "python -m dvc init" (creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. Now we do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
7. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
8. Now "python -m dvc add data/"
9. Again we do "git add data.dvc .gitignore"
10. Now "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
11. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data
